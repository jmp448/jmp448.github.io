I completed my undergraduate training at Cornell University in the Department of Biological Engineering. While there, I completed an honors thesis under Dan Luo and Shogo Hamada, working to combine the genetic and material properties of DNA to develop a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic device for point-of-care settings. I also worked in Ed Buckler\u0026rsquo;s plant computational genomics lab, striving to improve high-throughput phenotyping methods to facilitate the study of genotype-phenotype interactions.\nHere at Johns Hopkins, my research focus is on applying machine learning methods to look at the dynamic landscape of genetic regulation of gene expression.
